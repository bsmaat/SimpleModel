/// It accumulates statistic and computes dispersion of the energy deposit

/// H1D histograms are created in BeginOfRunAction() for the following 
/// physics quantities:
/// - Edep in absorber
/// - Edep in gap
/// - Track length in absorber
/// - Track length in gap
/// The same values are also saved in the ntuple.
/// The histograms and ntuple are saved in the output file in a format
/// accoring to a selected technology in B4Analysis.hh.
///
/// In EndOfRunAction(), the accumulated statistic and computed 
/// dispersion is printed.
